        Purrtective Paws is a small project focused on clear, plain-language resources that help everyday pet guardians protect their animals.
        The idea is simple: many people care deeply about their pets but do not know what to do when life gets messy. Breakups, moves, travel,
        emergencies, or a sudden disagreement with a landlord can leave people scrambling. This website aims to lower the stress by offering
        friendly explanations, helpful terms, and starter templates that make it easier to have productive conversations and keep pets safe.

        I am building this as a learning notebook and a practical toolkit. It is not a law firm and it does not give legal advice.
        Instead, it helps you get organized, gather the right documents, and understand the questions you may need to ask.
        Examples include a pet co-parenting agreement for separate households, a vet consent form so both guardians can access records,
        and a short checklist for renters who want to document permissions with a landlord. I also care about accuracy, so I note limits and
        suggest when to talk to a licensed attorney in your state. Over time, I hope to add a simple state-by-state overview of key pet rules,
        links to primary sources, and a few short explainers based on common scenarios people face.
    </p>

        If you have feedback or examples I should cover, I would love to hear from you. Your ideas can help shape this project and make it more useful for others.
