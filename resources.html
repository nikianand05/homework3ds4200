    This page summarizes how pet custody works when co-guardians, partners, or roommates separate.
    It’s based on educational resources from my main site,
    <a href="https://purrtectivepaws.com/pet-custody-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purrtective Paws</a>.
    Each section explains real-world examples and practical takeaways for keeping pets safe and loved.

      <h3>How Pet Custody Works</h3>
      <p>
        Pet custody is about who cares for a companion animal when two people—like ex-partners, roommates, or co-guardians—
        go their separate ways. While most people see pets as family, the law often sees them differently.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pets are still legally treated as personal property.</li>
        <li>Courts focus on ownership, not emotional bonds or caregiving.</li>
        <li>There’s no formal custody process unless you create one yourself.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This means the person who adopted or bought the pet may keep them, even if the other provided most of the daily care.

  <h3>What Courts Consider</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Legal ownership (adoption or purchase records)</li>
    <li>Who provides daily care (feeding, vet visits, etc.)</li>
    <li>Living situation (stability, pet-friendly housing)</li>
    <li>Bond with the pet (emotional connection, routine)</li>
    <li>Written agreements, even informal ones</li>
    <li>Best interest of the animal, if your state allows</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The best way to stay out of court is with a clear written agreement.

      <h3>Case Example: Acosta v. Shaw (New York)</h3>
      <p>
        This case involved a former couple who disagreed over who should keep their dog after breaking up.
        Although one person was the legal owner, the court looked at who provided daily care and emotional support.
        The judge ultimately considered what outcome would be best for the dog overall.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Acosta v. Shaw</em> reflects a growing trend in New York where pets aren’t treated as simple property.
        Under Domestic Relations Law §236B, courts can use the “best for all concerned” standard—looking at routine,
        care history, and emotional bonds—to decide what arrangement serves the pet’s well-being.
