Styling and Customizations

For my website, I used a soft green and off-white color palette that matches the theme of my existing website Purrtective Paws. It gives it a calm, natural look. I customized the headings, paragraphs, and buttons using CSS so everything feels consistent and easy to read. I added rounded corners, borders, and light box shadows to give the images and text blocks a clean but friendly layout. The navigation buttons change color when you hover over them, which makes the site feel a little more interactive. On the Resources page, each card has its own background, border, and padding for spacing. Across all pages, I adjusted margins, alignment, and font colors to make the text readable and centered on the page.

Overall, the customizations I used were:

A green and off-white color scheme
Custom buttons with hover effects
Rounded corners, borders, and shadows for structure
A three-column layout using flexbox for organization
Adjusted spacing and alignment to keep the layout balanced
A gallery of cat photos in the resources page
These small changes make the site simple but cohesive, and mantain the green calm color pallette going on.
