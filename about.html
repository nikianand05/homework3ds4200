  <div style="width:800px; margin:20px auto;">
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Niki, and this all started with a cat named Mushu.
      <br><br>
      We rescued Mushu during a snowy New Jersey winter when she followed my dad into the garage, drawn by the smell of groceries.
      She quickly became part of our family and was named after the dragon in <i>Mulan</i>. Years later, because of my sister’s allergies
      and a move across the world to Australia, we had to make the incredibly hard decision to place Mushu for adoption.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that I’m back in the U.S., I’ve been volunteering at a local cat shelter. It’s the closest I can get to having a pet of my own,
      and it allows me to give back in a meaningful way. Spending time with these animals, many of whom come from difficult situations,
      reminded me of my own. When things got complicated with Mushu, my family didn’t know what to do. We did what we thought was right,
      but looking back, I wish we had access to better information, more support, and someone to guide us. That experience, along with
      what I’ve seen at the shelter, is what inspired me to create this website.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#52796f;">Why I Created Purrtective Paws</h3>
    <p>
      This platform was built to bridge the gap between caring and knowing what to do. I’m not a lawyer (yet!), but I’m passionate
      about legal empowerment, animal welfare, and giving people the tools to stand up for those who can’t speak.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#52796f;">Personal Note</h3>
    <p>
      During my study abroad in Greece, I fell completely in love with all the cats everywhere. My roommate and I carried cat food
      (and dog food!) in our bags everywhere we went, feeding animals on sidewalks, in parks, even outside restaurants. My friends knew:
      if there was a cat on the street, I was sitting next to it. That experience, being surrounded by animals who just needed a little
      care, stuck with me. It reminded me how small actions can make a big difference, and it was another spark behind creating this platform.
      While Purrtective Paws is cat-inspired, it’s for all animals who need someone in their corner.
